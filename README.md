### Project Overview  
This project evaluates the effect of a redesigned UI on user performance in Vanguard Group’s online process. Using A/B testing, we compare a **Test Group** (new UI) against a **Control Group** to assess:  

- Completion rates  
- Error rates  
- Time to completion  

### Objectives   
1. Does the new UI help users complete the process faster?  
2. Does it reduce user errors?  
3. Does it improve completion rates?  
4. Does it achieve at least a 5% increase in completion rates (cost-effectiveness threshold)?  

### Data Sources  
- **Client Profiles (df_final_demo)** – Age, gender, and account details for user segmentation.  
- **Experiment Roster (df_final_experiment_clients)** – Identifies A/B test participants.  
- **Digital Footprints (df_final_web_data)** – Logs user interactions and process steps.  
  
### Results  
- **Completion Rate:** The Test Group outperformed the Control Group.  
- **Error Rate:** The Test Group showed higher error rates in Step 1.  
- **Time Taken:** The new UI increased completion time for some users, especially in early steps.
